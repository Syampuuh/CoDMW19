cp_mbi_arms_dealer,1.19,5.1,^2Laswell:^7 The criteria for mission success is to defeat Al-Qatala's supply chain.,,,
cp_mbi_arms_dealer,6.03,15.25,^2Kamarov:^7 This is an arms dealer they call, "Mr. Z." Z is wanted by the International Criminal Court for "conspiracy to transport, sell, and supply arms to a foreign terrorist organization.",,,
cp_mbi_arms_dealer,16.1,21.06,^2Laswell:^7 Mr. Z appears to have focused on one exclusive client, Al-Qatala's new number one...,,,
cp_mbi_arms_dealer,21.2,25.26,^2Laswell:^7 ...and has positioned himself as both supplier and advisor to the terrorist leader.,,,
cp_mbi_arms_dealer,26.11,35.06,^2Kamarov:^7 A volunteer physician on the ground, Dr. Linda Morales, informed us that Z's been using medical shipments as a front for moving hazardous materials into Verdansk.,,,
cp_mbi_arms_dealer,35.29,39.1,^2Kamarov:^7 Four hours ago, she was taken hostage by AQ operatives.,,,
cp_mbi_arms_dealer,39.18,46.13,^2Laswell:^7 Armistice's primary objective is to rescue Dr. Morales. If Z is bringing chemical weapons into this fight, she may know where to find them.,,,
cp_mbi_banker,0.05,4.26,^2Laswell:^7 The war in Verdansk runs on a black market. That means dirty money and someone to clean it.,,,
cp_mbi_banker,5.05,11.15,^2Kamarov:^7 For that, Al-Qatala uses a British banker, one of our primary HVTs and the man responsible for laundering their currency.,,,
cp_mbi_banker,11.29,18.25,^2Laswell:^7 We don't know the Banker's name, but we do know he runs a system of server farms that spit-shine AQ cash so they can weaponize the proceeds.,,,
cp_mbi_banker,19.07,27.06,^2Kamarov:^7 We need an assault force on the ground to shut these transactions down. Your team will target hostile forces for intel that points us to the Banker's crypto servers.,,,
cp_mbi_banker,27.18,34.15,^2Laswell:^7 Once you retrieve enough data, we'll triangulate it, freeze their assets, and attempt to revoke the birth certificate of the man who holds the purse strings.,,,
cp_mbi_banker,35.13,41,^2Laswell:^7 First and foremost, get in country, and round up AQ fighters for actionable intel on the Banker's operation.,,,
cp_mbi_landlord,0.05,4.27,^2Laswell:^7 This is Case Officer Laswell of the Coalition. I'm in joint command with Sergeant Kamarov of the Allegiance.,,,
cp_mbi_landlord,5.01,10.28,^2Kamarov:^7 We've put our differences aside. Together, as Armistice, this is our first direct action against the Al-Qatala army.,,,
cp_mbi_landlord,11.06,17.06,^2Laswell:^7 Your mission is to find, fix, and finish off high-value targets of the AQ network in Verdansk.,,,
cp_mbi_landlord,17.15,23.23,^2Kamarov:^7 These HVTs are powerful, well-connected collaborators, offering material aid and support to our enemy.,,,
cp_mbi_landlord,24,30.17,^2Laswell:^7 They all serve one new master, who's leading the Al-Qatala charge in Verdansk. To find him, we need to find them.,,,
cp_mbi_landlord,31.06,36.2,^2Kamarov:^7 Your first operation is against a high-ranking AQ figure they call "Almalik", the Landlord.,,,
cp_mbi_landlord,37.15,45.07,^2Laswell:^7 Almalik owns several warehouses across Verdansk, serving as Al-Qatala weapons depots. He's a slumlord for guns and terrorists.,,,
cp_mbi_landlord,45.24,52.27,^2Kamarov:^7 Your team will insert into the southern district to engage and capture enemy personnel for intel leading to Almalik's warehouses.,,,
cp_mbi_landlord,53.09,59.28,^2Laswell:^7 Get this right and we will nullify AQ's stockpiles. Hit the jackpot and we locate Almalik himself.,,,
cp_mbi_landlord,60.17,64.04,^2Laswell:^7 Be advised, if you find him, he will be well defended.,,,
cp_mbi_landlord,64.29,65.22,^2Laswell:^7 Good hunting.,,,
cp_mbi_outro,1.12,5.08,^2Laswell:^7 From the onset of this operation, the formation of Armistice ruffled feathers.,,,
cp_mbi_outro,5.25,8.02,^2Laswell:^7 They said Russian and the West couldn't work together...,,,
cp_mbi_outro,8.14,9.02,^2Laswell:^7 ...they were wrong.,,,
cp_mbi_outro,9.22,17.11,^2Kamarov:^7 Thanks to your assault teams, the Al-Qatala support network has been cut off and the power brokers that emboldened this terrorist threat have been eliminated.,,,
cp_mbi_outro,17.19,19.24,^2Laswell:^7 However, Mr. Z still remains at large.,,,
cp_mbi_outro,20.09,23.2,^2Laswell:^7 His weapons are locked and loaded in terrorist hands all over Verdansk.,,,
cp_mbi_outro,24.01,29.2,^2Laswell:^7 Our presence in the region is the only line of defense preventing Z and the new AQ boss from pushing through to Urzikstan.,,,
cp_mbi_outro,30.07,36.1,^2Kamarov:^7 This unknown leader is now calling his army, "Al-Qatala-Aljahdid", the 'New' Killers.,,,
cp_mbi_outro,37.04,42.17,^2Laswell:^7 These New Killers are calling him, "The Immortal Lion", or "Khaled Al-Asad".,,,
cp_mbi_smuggler,1.25,4.01,^2Laswell:^7 Our gains in Verdansk could kick the hornet's nest.,,,
cp_mbi_smuggler,4.25,9.23,^2Laswell:^7 As Armistice eliminates their upper echelon, Al-Qatala is making more aggressive and desperate moves.,,,
cp_mbi_smuggler,10.1,16.25,^2Kamarov:^7 This is 'El Traficante'. He helms a worldwide smuggling operation based in South America that moves contraband all over the globe.,,,
cp_mbi_smuggler,17.1,22.09,^2Laswell:^7 He protects himself, his customers, and his shipments. We're going after all three.,,,
cp_mbi_smuggler,22.22,28.04,^2Kamarov:^7 A local asset reported that El Traficante is moving something big across Verdansk before sundown.,,,
cp_mbi_smuggler,28.21,33.2,^2Kamarov:^7 At 0700, he transmitted a distress signal. That was our last contact.,,,
cp_mbi_smuggler,34.03,38.22,^2Laswell:^7 You need to reacquire the asset and learn what he knows about El Traficante's plan so we can stop it.,,,
cp_mbi_smuggler,39.08,45.2,^2Kamarov:^7 Infil your team to the north zone, where you'll assault a series of AQ safehouses. Search and send back any intel you find.,,,
cp_mbi_smuggler,46,52.11,^2Laswell:^7 Time is not on our side. If El Traficante is coordinating a move, AQ may be launching a strike tonight.,,,
