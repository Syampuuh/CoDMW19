# Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2019 client tracking

Tracking for changes to MW19. Files are extracted idling in Multiplayer menu immediately after booting the game for consistency, unless otherwise noted.

## *!assets* folder

Replication of Greyhound's output file structure with empty dummy files (because the full output is ~70gb) for tracking file additions. Changes will still be tracked locally by myself even if they don't show up on GitHub.

## What's up with the Lua scripts?

Seems to be an extraction limitation right now, only strings come through properly. That's fine though because just the strings alone already plenty of information.
